usage of test_app, for simple test.

cd test_app

make
 ==> sndkit

note: make sure 'ivModel_v21.irf' is under '/data/TestPcm/'

run:
sndkit -R -w test.wav -o 1

then speak "ling xi ling xi", console will print "System is Wake Up". or something like
that. the app is recording at the same time. 'test.wav' is the record file.
the driver only support 16K samplerate 16bit data width at the moment.
